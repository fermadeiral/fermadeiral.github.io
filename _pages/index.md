I am an assistant professor at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl/en). My research area is Software Engineering, and my broad research goal is to help developers produce and maintain high-quality software systems. I am interested in software bugs and their fixes, linter violations, and source code legibility and readability. I have performed source code analysis and manipulation, used machine learning, and mined software repositories for my research projects. I am also in love with dataset-related/-oriented research.

Short bio: I defended a Ph.D. thesis in Computer Science (2019) at the Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil, advised by Dr. Marcelo Maia. During my Ph.D., I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Inria Lille, France. I was a postdoctoral researcher at the São Paulo State University, Brazil, for six months (Jul 2019-Jan 2020), supervised by Dr. Rogério Garcia, and a postdoctoral researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, for two and a half years (Feb 2020-Aug 2022), supervised by Prof. Martin Monperrus.
